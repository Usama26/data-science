Question 1: Supervisor Selection

Read a list of tuples having your (linkedin id, Name ,linkedin headline, company name) , and input a tuple with details like 
(Student name, interests/roles (I am software engineer, php is my passion etc)) and traverse the dataset
which you made earlier to find if input interests/roles matches with dataset linkedin headline, if match occurs, we will be
fixing a supervisor for that student, output for this whole scenario will be
"Student XYZ will be supervised by ABC Person" and a zip having format (Student, Supervisor Name, Matched Interests) 
Also use Exception Handling.

Question 2: 
Try to make a list of almost 10 to 12 elements, and use list slicing to take the last 8 elements, and then take first 4 elements
from the updated list, reverse it, sort them and finally by using list comprehension give an expression that if a value is > 5,
then it will be appending those elements in a new list.

Question 3:
Text = "We are having a 'datascience' class, come join with us! ;), InshaAllah we are moving to 'Germany'....!!<3 <3 :D"
With the above text, task is to extract these emojis (' ;) ', ' :D ', ' <3 ') & strings in inverted commas. 
Once we have these, the next task is to replace these EMOJIs only to space characters and finally trim the whole sentence
to avoid extra spaces. Hint: We've built-in functions in python from trimming!

Question 4:
Consider any example of your own where you will be applying map, filter functions in a dataframe for any small task to
have a good grasp over these concepts
